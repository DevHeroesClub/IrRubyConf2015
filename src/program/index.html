                  It's time for Rubyists to come share their Ruby knowledge with their peers through the ME.RubyConf CFP. If you are interested in submitting a talk, please click 'Submit a talk'. There you will find details on how to submit a proposal, what we're looking for, and all you'll receive as a speaker. Thanks!
