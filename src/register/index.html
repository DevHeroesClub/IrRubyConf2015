                  This year, we're delighted to be able to offer a limited number of discounted student tickets.
                  Unfortunately, we are not able to offer any other type of discount (group, nonprofit, etc.).
                  For more information about obtaining the student discount, please email us at <span class="email"></span>.

                <p>
                  This year at ME.RubyConf 2015, we are offering a limited number of Supporter Tickets. These are meant for those
                  individuals or organizations who would like to support ME.RubyConf a bit more deeply than through the purchase
                  of a Standard Ticket, but are not interested in a full sponsorship.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Supporter Tickets cost $1,000 USD. They include everything that's part of the Standard Ticket,
                  as well as recognition (name and link) on the Sponsor page of our site. Supporter Tickets can be booked through
                  the 'Register Now' link on this page.
                </p>
