          <h1>What is IrRubyConf ?</h1>
          <p>
            IrRubyConf is the largest annual gathering for the community in Iran and Middle East using
            and developing the open-source Ruby programming language. IrRubyConf is organized by the
            <a href="//iranonrails.ir">IranOnRails</a> community for the community. We try to
            keep registration far cheaper than most comparable technology conferences in order to
            keep IrRubyConf accessible to the widest group possible.
